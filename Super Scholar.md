Do you know your Marvel vs DC superheroes and villans?

This is an Interactive front-end project.
Technologies used for this project include

The goal is to create a front-end web application that has interactive functionality and "Use[s] JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions".

I have decided to base my project on the Project Idea Example #2-
