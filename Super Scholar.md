# Super Scholar
*A Game to test your super knowledge*
Do you know your Marvel vs DC superheroes and villans?

## The Project

This is an Interactive front-end project.
Technologies used for this project include

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript

The goal is to create a front-end web application that has interactive functionality and "Use[s] JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions".

I have decided to base my project on the Project Idea Example #2-
Build a Memory Game.

**External Users Goals**
To have fun playing a game.

**Site Owner's Goal**
To have fun playing the game and build a game other's emjoy playing.

**Users Expectations**
To play a game that is visually appealing. Easy to navigate and provides clear instructions on how to play. As a player I want to know how I am progressing so I would like feedback such as a scoreboard.
